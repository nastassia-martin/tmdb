1. need to getItem (movies) or set to default empty arr. if no value then default to empty arr.
   ==> need to ensure it is of MovieType[] (so that u can add in objects)

2. check if the movie is already in LS

3. if not, add the movie to LSarr

4. call on LS hook in home page to render **10 movies** on to page
